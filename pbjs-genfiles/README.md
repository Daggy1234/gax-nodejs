This folder is used for auto-generated JavaScript files and TypeScript type definitions
generated by [`pbjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/protobufjs#pbjs-for-javascript) (from [`protobufjs`](https://github.com/protobufjs/protobuf.js/wiki)) based on the protobuf
definitions from the `protos` folder (currently only needed for operations.proto).

Use `npm run compile` to generate these files.
